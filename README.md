<h4>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Here is a summary of all the LINQ functions available in C#:</h4>

1. Aggregate: Performs a custom aggregation operation on a collection.
2. All: Determines whether all elements of a collection satisfy a condition.
3. Any: Determines whether any element of a collection satisfies a condition.
4. AsEnumerable: Returns an Enumerator for a collection.
5. Average: Computes the average of a collection of numeric values.
6. Cast: Converts a collection of objects to a specified type.
7. Concat: Concatenates two collections.
8. Contains: Determines whether a collection contains a specified element.
9. Count: Returns the number of elements in a collection.
10. DefaultIfEmpty: Returns a collection containing a default value if the source collection is empty.
11. Distinct: Returns a collection containing distinct elements from a collection.
12. ElementAt: Returns the element at a specified index in a collection.
13. ElementAtOrDefault: Returns the element at a specified index in a collection, or a default value if the index is out of range.
14. Except: Returns a collection containing the elements of one collection that do not appear in another collection.
15. First: Returns the first element of a collection that satisfies a specified condition.
16. FirstOrDefault: Returns the first element of a collection that satisfies a specified condition, or a default value if no such element is found.
17. GroupBy: Groups elements of a collection based on a specified key.
18. GroupJoin: Joins two collections based on a common key and groups the results.
19. Intersect: Returns a collection containing the elements that appear in both of two collections.
20. Join: Joins two collections based on a common key.
21. Last: Returns the last element of a collection that satisfies a specified condition.
22. LastOrDefault: Returns the last element of a collection that satisfies a specified condition, or a default value if no such element is found.
23. LongCount: Returns the number of elements in a collection as a long integer.
24. Max: Returns the maximum value in a collection of comparable values.
25. Min: Returns the minimum value in a collection of comparable values.
26. OfType: Filters a collection to include only elements of a specified type.
27. OrderBy: Sorts the elements of a collection in ascending order by a specified key.
28. OrderByDescending: Sorts the elements of a collection in descending order by a specified key.
29. Range: Generates a sequence of integer values within a specified range.
30. Repeat: Generates a sequence that contains a specified value repeated a specified number of times.
31. Reverse: Reverses the order of the elements in a collection.
32. Select: Projects each element of a collection into a new form.
33. SelectMany: Projects each element of a collection into a collection and flattens the resulting collections into a single collection.
34. SequenceEqual: Determines whethertwo collections are equal in terms of their elements and order.
35. Single: Returns the only element of a collection that satisfies a specified condition, or throws an exception if more than one element satisfies the condition or no elements are found.
36. SingleOrDefault: Returns the only element of a collection that satisfies a specified condition, or a default value if more than one element satisfies the condition or no elements are found.
37. Skip: Skips a specified number of elements in a collection and returns the remaining elements.
38. SkipWhile: Skips elements in a collection while a specified condition is true and returns the remaining elements.
39. Sum: Computes the sum of a collection of numeric values.
40. Take: Returns a specified number of elements from the beginning of a collection.
41. TakeWhile: Returns elements from a collection while a specified condition is true, and then skips the remaining elements.
42. ThenBy: Performs a secondary sort on the elements of a collection that have already been sorted by a primary key.
43. ThenByDescending: Performs a secondary sort in descending order on the elements of a collection that have already been sorted by a primary key.
44. ToArray: Converts a collection to an array.
45. ToDictionary: Converts a collection to a dictionary based on a specified key selector.
46. ToList: Converts a collection to a list.
47. Union: Returns a collection containing the unique elements that appear in either of two collections.
48. Where:Filters a collection based on a specified condition and returns the matching elements.
